## Description
This project begins where the intermediate level "[How's it going? Model Output vs Observations](model_vs_obs.md)" left off.
Students will extend their work by comparing the output from several models against an area averaged observations from a comparable area.
Statistics using xarray (built-in, xskillscore, or scipy with apply_ufunc)?
Introduce notebook widgets.
