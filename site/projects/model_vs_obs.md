## Description

For this project, participants will towards the goal of comparing output from a forecast model against observed data to get a sense of how well the model is performing in near real time.
For example, students may choose to compare the 2m forecast temperature from the latest run of the HRRR for the grid point closest to their location of choice against the observed 2m temperatures from the closest NWS station to the same location.
Highlight ways to enhance timeseries charts (time formatting on x-axis, latex labels on y-axis).
