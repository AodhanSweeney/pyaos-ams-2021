## Description

The "Plotting Satellite Data" Python training workshop is a great choice.
Students can learn how to find Sat data and use it to create visualizations.
Likely would be most useful broken up into multiple notebooks based on Bite-sized trainings.
This is a good idea because students may have a difficult time or minimal experience finding data or creating appealing graphs.
If I were participating in the conference, I'd sign up for this workshop because I would think that this is a useful skill that could help me in a related career field.
