Agenda

## Saturday/Sunday (January 9th, 10th): Workshop kickoff

Multiple, parallel sessions with the intent to bootstrap the workshop.
These will be small group based (approximately 10 - 15 students) and short (about 15 minutes).
Things to accomplish during this time:
  * Say hello, tell them a little bit about Unidata, cover the general idea of the workshop
  * Assign jupyterhub login information and make sure each student can get into the workshop environment.
  * Cover the very basics of the jupyterhub environment:
    * Exploring the interface and opening a notebook
    * Executing cells
    * Uploading an existing notebook / creating a new notebook
  * Point them to a set of asynchronous workshop resources, which will include a list of project ideas for three skill levels: never programmed at all or no experience with python, basic knowledge of python, advanced python user. (these need to be better defined, for sure).

Participants will be working in the Jypyterhub environment throughout the week, so these small group sessions will be critical.
It could also be a good time to encourage students to pair up into groups to work on the project together.

## Throughout the week of AMS (January 9th, 2021 â€” January 14th, 2021): Workshop

This will generally be a period of asynchronous exploration for the participants.
We will hold multiple formal "office hour" sessions throughout the week to assist participants directly.
While Unidata staff will be monitoring email/social media for questions, having the office hours will provide some structure to the otherwise nebulous nature of this period of the workshop.
Engaging with students using something like Google Hangout is what I'm thinking for the office hour help sessions.

## Thursday (January 14th, 2021): Workshop showcase
At the end of the week, Unidata will host a virtual workshop showcase.
This might involve hosting a website where we can publish student notebooks, providing space for real-time discussions during a set time (multiple Google Hangouts, Zoom with breakout rooms), etc.
